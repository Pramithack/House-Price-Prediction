# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using machine learning algorithms based on features such as the number of bedrooms, condition, area, and other property attributes.  
It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model training using **Linear Regression** and **Decision Tree Regressor**.

## 📊 Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to build and evaluate regression models to predict the price of houses using historical housing data.

The project includes:
- Loading and preprocessing the dataset  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature selection and data splitting  
- Model training and evaluation using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**

Both models were trained and compared to evaluate performance in predicting house prices.
